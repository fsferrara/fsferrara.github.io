I took a quiz offered by [aperian.com](https://aperian.com/) to build my, what they call, GlobeSmart profile.  
The result is interesting to share and compare. Here is mine.

> You enjoy working as part of a group. You're flexible about roles and titles, and willing to challenge your superiors if you feel it is necessary. You tend to be decisive and like to demonstrate quick results. You generally say what you mean, but you can also be subtle when needed. You value relationships and will not sacrifice them for a deadline.

Those who are Egalitarian tend to:

In contrast, those who are Status oriented tend to:

## You are in the middle between Direct and Indirect.

Those who are between Direct and Indirect tend to:

- Provide some context before coming to the point
- Be willing to disagree with others in a public forum, but will do so cautiously
- Generally say what they mean, but can also be subtle when needed

## You are moderately Relationship oriented.

Those who are Relationship oriented tend to:

- View time building relationships as key to achieving good results

In contrast, those who are Task oriented tend to:

- Place high value on reaching goals and objectives on schedule
- Prioritize accomplishing tasks over maintaining relationships
- Focus on what people achieve more than whom they know

## Any Thoughts?

What do you think? Do you think there is a perfect mix everyone should aim to, or a team should have mixed work profiles?
