Do you have fun while programming? Maybe you do think it is quite strange... Well, it's not! Just think of [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), that is defined as _"mind sport"_. An example is [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/), a website that provides a large collection of coding challenges submitted and edited by their the community. But it is not the only one, there are a lot of [other examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-10-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2016-fb8a5672d22f/).

<!-- truncate -->

A mixture of code challenge and gaming is [Coding Game](https://www.codingame.com/). Here it is clear that coding can be a playful activity.  
On the other hand, there is [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), the world's leading live streaming platform for gamers and the things we love. With Twitch it is possible to watch and chat in real-time with millions of other fans from around the world.

As a result, here it is [Saverio's Source Code twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/fsferrara). It has been created to acquire and share knowledge with others who may be interested while enjoying software programing.

If you like the idea, or you would like to propose a topic or project, please [get in touch](/about/)!
