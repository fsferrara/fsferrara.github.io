**How often have you sat through a meeting thinking, "This could have been an email?"** If you're like many, the answer is likely more than once. On average, employees spend a significant amount of time in unproductive meetings each month. For teams collaborating across multiple time zones, unproductive meetings are not an option. International companies can learn from completely remote teams: the key difference between running meetings in remote versus non-remote teams is asynchronous communication. Here’s how to conduct asynchronous meetings effectively to boost efficiency, enhance productivity, and reduce boredom.

## What is an Asynchronous Meeting?  
An asynchronous meeting is a meeting structure that doesn't require attendees to be present at the same time. This technique is popular among asynchronous organizations that focus on minimizing in-person communication, allowing employees to concentrate on deep work.

Instead of real-time interaction, participants share ideas through recorded voice, video, text, and other asynchronous methods over a defined period.

## When to Use Asynchronous Meetings  
Asynchronous meetings are suitable for discussions about specific topics that require collaboration over time. However, they are not ideal for status updates or quick discussions; those are better managed through text messages or emails.

## Structuring Your Asynchronous Meeting  
Like in-person meetings, asynchronous meetings should have a clear structure:

### Presentation (The Divergent Zone):  
The meeting document should begin with a presentation, which can be written or in the form of a video recording. The presentation must clearly state:
- The issue
- Its importance
- Proposed solutions

If there’s no issue to solve, an asynchronous meeting isn’t necessary.

To ensure everyone is on the same page, tag participants and ask them to acknowledge that they’ve reviewed the presentation. Requesting participants to leave a comment confirming they watched the presentation ensures they are updated and encourages engagement.

### Discussion (The Groan Zone):  
During this phase, participants add their comments and ideas to the meeting document within a set deadline. Discuss the comments and aim to resolve as many issues as possible. If some issues require deeper conversation, schedule brief synchronous meetings with the relevant individuals and then update the meeting document with the results.

### Conclusion (The Convergent Zone):  
Once the contribution window closes, summarize the meeting's conclusions in the document. In particular:
- Include clear commitments and next steps.
- Recap any follow-up actions that were planned.

## The Meeting Document: Your Asynchronous Meeting Hub  
The meeting document is the central tool for an asynchronous meeting. Use a collaborative tool that allows commenting and status tracking, such as Slack, Confluence, or Google Docs. Notifications for new edits and comments are essential.

Your meeting document should include:
- A title, the date, and the name of the facilitator
- A deadline for contributions
- The presentation of the issue
- A discussion section for participants to share their thoughts
- A conclusion summarizing decisions and next steps

## Essential Tools for Asynchronous Meetings  
Having the right tools is crucial for successful asynchronous meetings:
- **Screen Recording Software**: Use tools like Vidyard or Loom to record presentations, ideally including your webcam for a personal touch.
- **Project Management Tools**: Platforms like Asana, Fellow, Google Docs, and Slack enable commenting and notifications. For example, Slack's canvas feature allows you to link conversations within the document for easy reference.

## The Facilitator's Role  
The facilitator is essential in guiding the asynchronous meeting. Specifically, the facilitator should:
- Set timelines and involve participants.
- Summarize comments and keep the discussion on track.
- Ensure the issue is clear, its importance is understood, and proposed solutions are well-defined.

## How to Keep Participants Engaged  
Keeping everyone engaged in an asynchronous meeting can be challenging. Here are some strategies:
- When introducing new asynchronous meeting practices, encourage contributions and offer guidance.
- To address limited engagement, be clear about when help or input is needed.
- When concluding the meeting, emphasize that the goal is to summarize and wrap up discussions.
- If some team members are not proactive, direct encouragement may be necessary to ensure their participation.
- Address potential passivity by emphasizing that clear intentions and expectations are essential.
- Even if a solution isn't reached, highlight the value of documenting discussions and decisions for future reference.
- To increase engagement, require participants to acknowledge that they have reviewed the presentation.

## Integrating Synchronous Communication  
Even in asynchronous meetings, integrating synchronous components can be beneficial. For unresolved issues, organize synchronous meetings with the relevant participants. After the synchronous meeting, update the meeting document with any new information or decisions.

## Checklist for Making Asynchronous Meetings Work  
- Record your presentations: Use screen recording software to ensure clarity and engagement. 

By following these guidelines, you can improve your asynchronous meetings to be more effective and productive for everyone involved.
