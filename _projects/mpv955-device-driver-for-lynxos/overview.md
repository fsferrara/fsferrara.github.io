💻 **Academic Project** • _September 2004 → May 2005_  
🏫 [Bachelor’s Student]({{ site.data.links.education.bachelor-degree.page }})  
🏢 Intern at [VIRGO Lab (INFN), Department of Physical Sciences](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/)  
📍 _Naples Area, Italy_  

I wrote the **MPV955 Device Driver for LynxOS**, a Unix-like real-time operating system from LynuxWorks (sometimes known as the Lynx Operating System). LynxOS features are: full POSIX conformance and Linux compatibility.

LynxOS is mostly used in real-time embedded systems, in applications for avionics, aerospace, the military, industrial process control and telecommunications.

The department of phisical science needed this driver for the "Virgo" experiment.

The Virgo detector for gravitational waves consists mainly in a Michelson laser interferometer made of two orthogonal arms being each 3 kilometers long. Multiple reflections between mirrors located at the extremities of each arm extend the effective optical length of each arm up to 120 kilometers. Virgo is located within the site of EGO, European Gravitational Observatory, based at Cascina, near Pisa on the river Arno plain.

I was really lucky to join this experiment and look after such an interesting activity.
