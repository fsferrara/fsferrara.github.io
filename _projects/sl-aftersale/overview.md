**SL AfterSale** created as a tool used by operators in the automotive sector to ensure that, after sale, the restoration of all the features of the vehicle in case of failure.

Once you have bought the vehicle in fact, the customer will be contacted directly by one of our consultants, who from that time became his only point of reference for any type of problem on the vehicle, offering safety, reliability and timeliness in resolving problems which up to that time had necessarily to manage the showroom.

During this project I wrote my first WordPress plugin. It allows the management of customers, car, and damage. The plugin contains both the part related to the user, and the back-office reserved for consultants.
