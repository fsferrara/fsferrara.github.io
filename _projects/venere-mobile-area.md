**Venere.com** (an Expedia Inc. company), is the Italian leader in the online hotel reservations market. Venere.com features real-time rates, availability, special offers and the best deals on the web.

I looked after the mobile part of the business. First by enhancing the existing website in order to make it responsive. Then I gained experience in the Android Native App programming by doing maintenance to the existing Venere Android App.

In the end I designed and implemented a prototype of a new Venere App based on Hybrid Technologies.
