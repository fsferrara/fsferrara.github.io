💻 **Work Project** • _March 2014 → June 2015_  
🏢 [Software Dev Engineer I at Venere.com]({{ site.data.links.experience.expedia-group-software-dev-engineer-1.page }})  
📍 _Rome Area, Italy_  

**Venere.com** (an Expedia Inc. company), was the Italian leader in the online hotel reservations market. Venere.com featured real-time rates, availability, special offers and the best deals on the web.

I looked after the mobile part of the business. First by enhancing the existing website in order to make it responsive. Then I gained experience in the Android Native App programming by doing maintenance to the existing Venere Android App.

In the end I designed and implemented a prototype of a new Venere App based on Hybrid Technologies.
