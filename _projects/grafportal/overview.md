💻 **Work Project** • _September 2000 → July 2001_  
🏢 [Web Developer at Advanced Systems]({{ site.data.links.experience.advanced-systems-web-developer.page }})  
📍 _Naples Area, Italy_  

GrafPortal was an online printing service. With the best printing technology, you can print high-quality books, both small and large production runs. A team of experts will follow you and advise you in all phases of your product. Create and print a book, a catalog, a brochure or a thesis will be easy.

During this project I worked on the web application form to ask for an estimate of the price, on the realization of the user area, and on the entire back-office systems used to assist users during the printing process.
