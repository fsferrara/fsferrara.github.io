This course on Active Listening explores the foundations of empathetic and emotionally intelligent communication. It provides practical tools for improving professional and personal interactions, with a focus on feedback, trust-building, and conflict resolution.

For me, it was a complement to [The Little Guide to Empathetic Technical Leadership](/learnings/books/the-little-guide-to-empathetic-technical-leadership/) book.


### Topics and Competencies

- Practicing active and empathetic listening
- Applying emotional intelligence in conversations
- Giving and receiving feedback using the SBI model
- Managing difficult conversations with calm and clarity
- Recognizing emotional cues and responding with empathy
- Strengthening relationships through reflective listening
