## Covered concepts

This course focuses on transforming everyday listening into a powerful skill for building stronger relationships, handling feedback, and improving professional and personal outcomes.
It was for me an addition to my previous knowledge acquired as Technical Leader. Related to [The Little Guide to Empathetic Technical Leadership](../../../../notes/books/the-little-guide-to-empathetic-technical-leadership/overview/).

### 🧠 Emotional Intelligence in Listening
- Read body language, tone, and emotional cues.
- Use empathy and self-awareness to build trust and connection.

### 🧏 Empathetic & Reflective Listening

### 💼 Practical Workplace Applications
