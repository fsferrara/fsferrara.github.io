Venere.com (an Expedia Inc. company) was the Italian leader in online hotel reservations.
The technologies mainly used by the company are Java and Spring, for the building of RESTful backend web services, and Javascript/Node.js for the frontend layer. We rely on several persistence technologies, both SQL and NoSQL (MySQL, Redis, Couchbase, ...).
Experience developing hybrid mobile applications (iOS, Android, Windows Phone) using Apache Cordova, Backbone, Handlebars, and RequireJS.
As an agile company, I belong to a development team using the Scrum Framework, where I gained experience in facilitating meetings and in managing a development team.
