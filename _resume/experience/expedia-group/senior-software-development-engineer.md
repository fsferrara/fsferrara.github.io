- **Native App Development (iOS Focus):** Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode & Debugging, Saving/Networking/Concurrency in iOS, iOS Design Patterns (MVC, MVVM, Architecting for SwiftUI, Platform Patterns), Performance Architecture, iOS learning path facilitation, new hire onboarding.
- **API & Microservices:** GraphQL stack, Apollo GraphQL gateway unification, REST Kernel for traveler experience APIs.
- **Cloud & Infrastructure:** Cloud migration of two REST services to AWS (e.g. SRLE, SAI), Common configuration framework adoption, Feature Config proposal for configuration management, Hbox linux virtual machine for developer ramp-up.
- **Technical Leadership & Mentorship:** Formalizing problems/solutions, technical sharing, RFCs (Request for Comments) for consensus building, coaching junior engineers, facilitating learning paths, promoting ownership, technical direction, community evangelism, conflict mediation.
- **Collaboration & Communication:** Cross-functional collaboration, asynchronous communication, stakeholder management, global team dynamics, technical documentation, clear/concise messaging, influencing strategies.
- **Process Improvement & Reliability:** Optimizing team processes, reducing cycle time, defining milestones, detailed story creation, automating OpEx reporting, advocating reliability standards, vulnerability remediation.
- **Emerging Technologies:** AI tools for workflow enhancement (future exploration).

**Achieved Results:**
- **Led the definition and advancement of the Real User Monitoring (RUM) API**, a pivotal initiative to **enhance observability for native applications** and influence the same effort for the Web client, laying the foundation for future app monitoring improvements.
- **Successfully integrated Datadog RUM SDK** through an initial Proof of Concept (PoC) and subsequent rollout, establishing a **crucial performance monitoring solution** that directly impacts app performance insights.
- **Drove the implementation of Performance Tracker for iOS and Android**, implemented the initial-load metric monitoring for the **top 7 screens** and enabling teams to collect user-perceived performance metrics. Orchestrated workshops to facilitate team adoption.
- **Pioneered a strategy to evolve the initial load custom metric** to align with industry performance trends (TTIL), leading to agreements on **Real User Performance Monitoring on Native** and instrumenting the initial iOS screens.
- Played a central role in **organizing and delivering in-person iOS development training** that accelerated onboarding for new joiners, fostered cross-team knowledge sharing, and received overwhelmingly positive feedback.
- **Mentored and ramped up three new iOS developers**, ensuring their independent contribution to native application development through consistent support, code reviews, and a structured onboarding programs that considered the Rome/Chicago timezone difference.
- **Pioneered the Application Hygiene initiative**, defining its scope, establishing a documentation hub, and introducing the concept of an **Application Hygiene Score** to drive continuous dependency version updates and improve overall app quality.
- **Improved production anomaly detection for legacy nodejs applications** through **SLI/SLO implementation** and actively promoted reliability standards across the organization with documentation and team meetings.
- **Achieved fine-grained component performance tracking on Datadog for iOS**, including making Container and Shared-UI Components UI Events available and creating flame graphs for performance troubleshooting.
- **Led collaboration for GraphQL Gateway unification** and its evolution into a managed platform, contributing to the success of a **multi-brand UI**.
- **Chaired recurring meetings between distributed engineering teams**, enabling stronger collaboration and facilitating the adoption of new software versions critical for future API strategies with the unified GraphQL Gateway.
