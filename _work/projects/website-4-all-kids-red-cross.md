As part of EG‚Äôs employee volunteering program, I dedicated my time and expertise to support the Red Cross Chapter in Rome, focusing on children with physical, mental, and economic disabilities. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, these children faced increased isolation, making it essential to provide new ways to connect and learn.

Collaborating with a distributed team of volunteers across Europe, I led the technical effort to configure a multisite WordPress installation for the Red Cross. This allowed the creation of a new subsite for volunteers to share educational games, stories, and community updates, fostering engagement and inclusion for children unable to attend in-person activities.
In addition, I configured the Wordpress Polylang plugin to support both Italian and English, for multilingual content, including language-specific games and resources.

This project exemplifies the power of volunteering and technology to create meaningful social impact, providing children with disabilities new opportunities for learning and connection.
