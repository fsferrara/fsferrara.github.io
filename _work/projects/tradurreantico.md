**TradurreAntico.it** is a website primarily intended for high school students. Allows the sharing of translations of ancient texts written originally in Latin and ancient greek. All translations are supervised by a professional translator.

During this project, I wrote my first Joomla component. It allows the management and publishing of translated texts. Optimized for search engines with a clean HTML and URL generated properly.
Later, I migrated the entire website to Wordpress. I had a lot of fun with the HTTP redirects that allowed to not lose the rank on google.
