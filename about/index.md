**Hello,** 👋  
my name is Saverio and I work as software engineer and a passionate software developer 💻 living in Rome 🇮🇹.  
Adaptable, proactive, creative and addicted to the Linux 🐧 operating system.  
I love learning new things and working with all the open-source technologies.  

In my spare time, I like do mountain biking 🚴 and playing casual video games 🕹️.
