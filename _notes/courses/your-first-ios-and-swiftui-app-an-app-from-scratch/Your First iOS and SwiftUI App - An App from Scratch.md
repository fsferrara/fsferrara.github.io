## Learning path

This is part of the **iOS and SwiftUI for Beginners** learning path. [View path](https://www.kodeco.com/ios/paths/learn).

## Who is this for?

Total beginners — no Swift, iOS, or previous developer knowledge required! This course walks you through building an app from scratch.

You’ll start by learning the basics of SwiftUI, a new way for iOS developers to build user interfaces for their apps using Swift. You’ll also dive into the Swift programming language itself, learning fundamentals like if/else statments, variables, constants, type inference, and the Swift standard library. You’ll add more cool functionality to your game and practice your new coding skills.

You’ll even learn useful techniques you’ll use as a developer in the real world, like App Architecture and Unit Testing!

This course isn’t suited for intermediate or advanced developers. If that’s you, check out our intermediate or advanced video courses for more ways to level up your developer skills.
