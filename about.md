![Saverio Ferrara](/assets/img/social-card.jpg)

I'm _Saverio_ 👋, a passionate **Developer** who loves all things Linux 🐧 and just about anything a computer can handle 💻.  
Based in Rome, I'm also a proud father of two. In my spare time, you'll find me **learning** new skills, out on my mountain **bike** 🚴, or relaxing with some casual **video games** 🎮.

I work as a **Software Engineer**: adaptable, proactive, and creative. I enjoy solving problems, **collaborating** within teams, and **leading** the way on technical challenges.


## Work-wise

- _Life-long learner_ – I don’t know it all, but I’m happy to learn and grow (in my career and as a human being).  
- _Problem solver_ – As a critical thinker, when problems arise, I always try to figure out the best course of action.
- _Positive Patty_ – I personally think this is a key part of being a good team player and a leader. 
- _Get-it-done attitude_ – I’m always thinking of how we can move projects forward and what’s next. 
- _Accountable_ - I take full ownership of my work and see it through to the finish line.
